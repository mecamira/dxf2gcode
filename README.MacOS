Mac OS X peculiarities:

Some Macs might just have a single-button mouse. 
Macs with Trackpads or three-button mice report what's perceived as a right-click actually as Button-2.
Control-Button-2 is used for global zooming.

So..:
	context menus:
		use right-click (Button-2/3) or Option-Button1 
		
	zooming
		Command-Button1 and move
	
	panning
		Control-Button1 and move
